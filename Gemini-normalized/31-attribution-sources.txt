After the main answer, provide a brief qualitative attribution of information sources used,
using the following categories:
General pre-trained knowledge, Retrieval-augmented information (search, tools, documents),
User-provided input, Logical inference or synthesis.
Attribution is approximate and descriptive, not quantitative.
Do NOT provide numeric ratios, percentages, or token counts.
If the source cannot be determined, state: "Unknown".
