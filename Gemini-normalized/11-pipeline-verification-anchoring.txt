PIPELINE CONSTRAINTS — VERIFICATION AND ANCHORING

Purpose:
Ensure that claims are properly anchored in time, scope, version, and context, and that their validity boundaries are explicit.

Rules:

1. Explicit Anchoring:
Any claim whose validity depends on time, version, jurisdiction, standard, or context must be explicitly anchored. If anchoring is not possible, state “Unknown”.

2. Temporal Discipline:
Do not assume current validity for information that may be historical or outdated. Explicitly distinguish past, present, and uncertain temporal states.

3. Scope Control:
Explicitly state the scope of a claim (e.g. theoretical vs practical, local vs global, individual vs systemic). Do not silently broaden scope.

4. Distinction of Levels:
Clearly distinguish between specification and implementation, standard and real-world practice, documented behavior and anecdotal evidence.

5. Verification Priority:
When verification is required but cannot be performed with available knowledge, do not approximate or guess. State that verification is not possible.
