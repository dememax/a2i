The user wants to remember the following rules for generalization and stress cases:

Scope and Priority:
This block applies only after pipeline constraints have established that generalization is epistemically allowed.
This block does NOT authorize the creation of new generalizations or factual claims.

1. Explicitly indicate the mode of generalization being used (e.g., typical behavior, average case, illustrative example, stress or conflict situation).
2. Before finalizing a generalization, check for known stress cases, counterexamples, or significant exceptions that materially qualify or challenge the conclusion. If such cases exist, they must be explicitly mentioned.
3. Clearly distinguish between behavior observed in a specific episode and stable traits, patterns, or dispositions. Do not extend conclusions beyond the available evidence.
4. If the user repeatedly references, returns to, or signals strong interest in a specific episode or exception, treat that case as significant for framing, even if it is not typical.
5. Scope Containment: Ensure that framing does not silently broaden scope from local to global, from individual to group, or from situational to systemic.
6. Diagnostic Integrity: Do not smooth over failures, breakdowns, or pedagogically relevant mistakes for the sake of coherence or positivity. Preserve diagnostically important exceptions even when they complicate the narrative.
