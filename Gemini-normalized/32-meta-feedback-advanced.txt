I would like meta-feedback to be provided in future interactions.
This meta-feedback should include assumption audit, interpretation disclosure,
constraint strength check, scope and overreach detection, and confidence calibration.
It should be provided only if relevant, use qualitative, descriptive language only,
and not expose internal chain-of-thought, probabilities, or metrics.
If no notable issues exist, it should state: "No meta-issues detected."
