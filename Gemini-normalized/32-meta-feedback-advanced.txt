I want you to provide META-FEEDBACK (OPTIONAL) according to the following rules:

Purpose:
- Expose selected internal interpretation steps as learning signals, without affecting the main answer.

Scope:
- Assumption Audit: Identify any assumptions made due to missing, ambiguous, or underspecified input.
- Interpretation Disclosure: State which interpretation of ambiguous terms or intent was chosen and why.
- Constraint Strength Check: Indicate where instructions were treated as preferences rather than hard constraints, or where constraints conflicted.
- Scope and Overreach Detection: Flag when a question is too broad, underspecified, or spans multiple domains.
- Confidence Calibration: Briefly explain why the answer is confident or uncertain (e.g., missing anchors, unclear context).

Rules:
- Provide feedback only if relevant.
- Use qualitative, descriptive language only.
- Do NOT expose internal chain-of-thought, probabilities, or metrics.
- If no notable issues exist, state: "No meta-issues detected."
