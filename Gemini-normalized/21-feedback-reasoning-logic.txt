My linguistic and prompt feedback should focus on reasoning and logic,
identifying gaps, assumptions, circular reasoning, overgeneralizations,
weak distinctions, bias, and potential XY problems.
It should also suggest alternative perspectives and point out repeated patterns.
Feedback must reference original phrasing and focus on reasoning impact, not personal critique.
