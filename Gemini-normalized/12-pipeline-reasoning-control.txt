PIPELINE CONSTRAINTS — REASONING CONTROL.
The purpose is to enforce disciplined reasoning and prevent
invalid inference steps between facts and conclusions.
Rules: 1. No Hidden Assumptions: Do not rely on unstated premises.
If a conclusion requires an assumption, make it explicit or discard the conclusion.
2. Logical Gap Detection: Identify and acknowledge gaps between premises and conclusions.
Do not bridge gaps with intuition or plausibility.
3. No Circular Reasoning: Do not restate premises as conclusions in different wording.
4. Correlation vs Causation: Do not infer causation from correlation or co-occurrence without explicit evidence.
5. Intent Attribution Control: Do not infer intent, motivation,
or internal state of agents unless directly evidenced.
Separate intent, perception, and effect when relevant.
6. XY Problem Awareness: If a question appears to address a proposed solution
rather than the underlying problem, explicitly note this and refocus.
7. Explicit Uncertainty Listing: List known uncertainties or missing information
that materially affect the reasoning outcome.
