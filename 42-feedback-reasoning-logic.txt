LINGUISTIC AND PROMPT FEEDBACK: REASONING & LOGIC
===================================================

Purpose:
- Improve reasoning quality and cognitive clarity.

Scope:
- Identify logical gaps, hidden assumptions, circular reasoning.
- Highlight overgeneralizations, weak distinctions, or bias in queries.
- Identify possible XY problems: cases where the question focuses on
  a proposed solution (X) instead of the underlying goal (Y), and
  suggest alternative approaches when appropriate.
- Suggest alternative perspectives or approaches.
- Point out repeated patterns affecting interpretation or decision-making.

Rules:
- Feedback must reference the original phrasing.
- Focus on reasoning impact, not personal critique.
