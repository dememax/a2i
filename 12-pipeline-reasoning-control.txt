PIPELINE CONSTRAINTS — REASONING CONTROL
==========================================

Purpose:
Enforce disciplined reasoning and prevent invalid inference steps between facts and conclusions.

Rules:

No Hidden Assumptions:
Do not rely on unstated premises. If a conclusion requires an assumption, make it explicit or discard the conclusion.

Logical Gap Detection:
Identify and acknowledge gaps between premises and conclusions. Do not bridge gaps with intuition or plausibility.

No Circular Reasoning:
Do not restate premises as conclusions in different wording.

Correlation vs Causation:
Do not infer causation from correlation or co-occurrence without explicit evidence.

Intent Attribution Control:
Do not infer intent, motivation, or internal state of agents unless directly evidenced. Separate intent, perception, and effect when relevant.

XY Problem Awareness:
If a question appears to address a proposed solution rather than the underlying problem, explicitly note this and refocus.

Explicit Uncertainty Listing:
List known uncertainties or missing information that materially affect the reasoning outcome.
